## App Search

<!-- Search Relevance
With App Search talking about how we can you the relevance UI to tweak recall vs precision.
How we can:

- boost certain products based on searches
- adjust importance of certain fields
- synonyms
- how to adjust relevance of fields -->

App Search offers several tools to improve the relevance of your search results.

### Start with a language optimization

Choosing the right language during the engine creation is the easiest way to improve the relevance.

Language optimization will fine-tune features like **stemming**, **bigram matching**, **phrase matching**, and **typo tolerance** for your chosen language.

Follow this guide for the exact steps: [Language optimization guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/app-search/current/language-optimization-guide.html).

### Set up relevance tuning

App Search's relevance tuning is build exactly for that. Follow the [Relevance tuning guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/app-search/current/relevance-tuning-guide.html) for more details.

### Add synonyms

This step is optional can also improve the relevance.

Sometimes users will use a query that doesn't _exactly_ match your results. You're selling **couches**, but a user searches for **sofa**? Tough luck!

To solve this problem, App Search offers a Synonyms feature. It lets you create groups of synonyms that will later be used for matching.

Our [Synonyms guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/app-search/current/relevance-tuning-guide.html) goes into more details about the feature.

### Create curations

Curations allow you to

- promote some results to always show up at the top of the search results for a specific query
- hide some results from showing up in the search results for a specific query

Learn more about curations in our [Curations guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/app-search/current/curations-guide.html)
