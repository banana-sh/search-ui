In ecommerce, to build great search experiences for your customers, you need to focus on these major experiences:

- **Global Search bar**: to find products that match your customers’ needs. Provide suggestions as they type for products and queries they might want to search for.
- **Category Page**: To show a list of products that match your customers’ needs in a particular category. Offer rich filtering and navigation options to refine the products.
- **Product Carousels**: Provide Product Carousels highlighting products that match your customers’ needs within pages like the Homepage, Checkout or when there's no results.
- **Search Page**: Give your customers a great experience to find products that they are specifically looking for. Offer rich filtering and navigation options to refine the products.
- **Product Detail Page**: Provide product suggestions that are relevant to the product they're looking with you may also like and frequently bought with.
