This is a category page:

<DocImage

  alt="Category page"
/>

At the first glance, category page looks very similar to search page â€” they both display a list of products and have facets to help users refine the results.
But while search page is made for "searching" the entire catalog by typing a query, category page is mostly made for "exploring" a small subset of products with the help of filters.

In this example, we are only exploring the "Women's Athletic Shoes" section of the catalog.

In this article we will discuss how to implement a product category page.

## Applying Filters to the Category Page

It's important to consider SEO of a category page. Some of your customers will come from search engines and having a good-looking URL will help you rank higher.

Let's say we want to have a category page for TVs. It can be done by taking a general search page and applying a filter to only show TVs.

Now, if we do so on a search page, we'll have a URL like this:

```
mystore.com/search?filters%5B0%5D%5Bfield%5D=categories&filters%5B0%5D%5Bvalues%5D%5B0%5D=TVs
```

Not very readable!

What we want instead is to have a URL like this:

```
mystore.com/category/tvs/
```

To achieve that, we'll need to:

1. Create the category page in our application;
1. Apply a filter via Search UI config.

The first part is highly dependent on your application's framework. Refer to its documentation for creating a new page.

For the second part, take the Search UI config you're using on the search page and add the `searchQuery.filters` value. Then pass the new config to your `SearchProvider`:

```jsx
// import your Search UI config
import { config } from "./config";
import { SearchProvider, WithSearch } from "@elastic/react-search-ui";

const categoryTvsConfig = {
  ...config,
  searchQuery: {
    ...config.searchQuery,
    // adding a filter to only show TVs
    filters: [{ field: "parent_category", values: ["TVs"] }]
  }
};

export default function CategoryPageTvs() {
  return (
    // Pass the new config to SearchProvider
    <SearchProvider config={categoryTvsConfig}>
      <WithSearch mapContextToProps={() => ({})}>
        {() => {
          // The components you want to render go here
        }}
      </WithSearch>
    </SearchProvider>
  );
}
```

That's it! Now the new category page will have a good URL and will only show the results that match the filter.

## Facets

  alt="Facets"
/>

Facets is the most important part of the category page. Since category pages typically don't have their own search box, facets become the main tool to help users find the products they are looking for.

_Facets let users **explore** what's available in your store, rather then **search** for a specific product._

To help users find what they're looking for, it's best to provide a list of facets that are unique to the presented category.

In our example of TVs category page, in addition to common facets, like:

- Price
- Brand
- Rating

we also have TV-specific facets:

- Smart TV _(boolean)_
- TV resolution _(string: "Full HD", "4k", etc.)_
- TV diagonal _(number)_

These TV-specific facets are not useful on the search page, since they are not relevant to most of the results.

There are several ways to implement this in Search UI. They offer different levels of control and flexibility.

1. All category pages share a single config. This is the simplest option to implement but it's also least flexible and least performant.
1. All category pages share a single config, but the facets are shown conditionally. This is a middle ground in terms of simplicity and flexibility and as performant as the next option.
1. Each category page uses it's own config. This is the most flexible and most performant option but it requires more work to implement.

### Single config

It is possible to use a single Search UI config on the search page and all category pages. This comes with a performance drawback: the facets data will be requested on every page even if it's not going to be used. The decision is up to you: single config will work as well as separate configs if most of your documents share the same properties.

To implement this, you'll need to:

1. Add new result fields to `searchQuery.resultFields`
1. Add new facets to `searchQuery.facets`
1. (optional) Add new disjunctiveFacets `searchQuery.disjunctiveFacets`

Then, add the `Facet` components to UI.

The result code will look something like this:

```jsx
// import your Search UI config
import { SearchProvider, WithSearch } from "@elastic/react-search-ui";

const config = {
  searchQuery: {
    // 1. Adding new resilt fields, these will be used for the facets
    result_fields: {
      tv_size: { raw: {} },
      tv_smart_tv: { raw: {} },
      tv_resolution: { raw: {} }
      // some other fields
    },
    // 2. Adding the new facets
    facets: {
      tv_size: {
        type: "value",
        sort: { value: "asc" }
      },
      tv_smart_tv: {
        type: "value"
      },
      tv_resolution: {
        type: "value",
        sort: { value: "asc" }
      }
      // some other facets
    },
    // 3. Making some of newly added facets disjunctive
    disjunctiveFacets: ["tv_size", "tv_resolution"]
  }
};

export default function CategoryPage() {
  return (
    // Pass the config to SearchProvider
    <SearchProvider config={config}>
      <WithSearch mapContextToProps={() => ({})}>
        {() => {
          return (
            // The components you want to render go here
            // For the sake of brevity, we're only showing the new facets
            <>
              <Facet field="tv_smart_tv" label="Smart TV" view={BooleanFacet} />
              <Facet field="tv_resolution" label="Resolution" />
              <Facet field="tv_size" label="Diagonal size" />
            </>
          );
        }}
      </WithSearch>
    </SearchProvider>
  );
}
```

### Conditional facets

Search UI allows you to show facets conditionally based on the applied filters.
Follow the main guide for more info and code examples: <DocLink id="guides-conditional-facets" text="Conditional facets" />.

### Each category page uses it's own config

This option closely follows the single config option, but requires you to make a copy of the main Search UI config (that you use on the search page) first.

1. Import and make a copy of the main Search UI config
1. Add new result fields to `searchQuery.resultFields`
1. Add new facets to `searchQuery.facets`
1. (optional) Add new disjunctiveFacets `searchQuery.disjunctiveFacets`

Then, add the `Facet` components to UI.

Here's how to do it all at once:

```jsx
// import your Search UI config
import { config } from "./config";
import { SearchProvider, WithSearch } from "@elastic/react-search-ui";

const categoryTvsConfig = {
  ...config,
  searchQuery: {
    ...config.searchQuery,
    filters: [{ field: "parent_category", values: ["TVs"] }],
    // 1. Adding new resilt fields, these will be used for the facets
    result_fields: {
      ...config.searchQuery.result_fields,
      tv_size: { raw: {} },
      tv_smart_tv: { raw: {} },
      tv_resolution: { raw: {} }
    },
    // 2. Adding the new facets
    facets: {
      ...config.searchQuery.facets,
      tv_size: {
        type: "value",
        sort: { value: "asc" }
      },
      tv_smart_tv: {
        type: "value"
      },
      tv_resolution: {
        type: "value",
        sort: { value: "asc" }
      }
    },
    // 3. Making some of newly added facets disjunctive
    disjunctiveFacets: [
      ...config.searchQuery.disjunctiveFacets,
      "tv_size",
      "tv_resolution"
    ]
  }
};

export default function CategoryPageTvs() {
  return (
    // Pass the new config to SearchProvider
    <SearchProvider config={categoryTvsConfig}>
      <WithSearch mapContextToProps={() => ({})}>
        {() => {
          return (
            // The components you want to render go here
            // For the sake of brevity, we're only showing the new facets
            <>
              <Facet field="tv_smart_tv" label="Smart TV" view={BooleanFacet} />
              <Facet field="tv_resolution" label="Resolution" />
              <Facet field="tv_size" label="Diagonal size" />
            </>
          );
        }}
      </WithSearch>
    </SearchProvider>
  );
}
```

### Example

Search UI offers several kinds of facets out-of-the-box:

- MultiCheckboxFacet
- BooleanFacet
- SingleLinksFacet

Here's an example of how to use them:

```jsx
import { BooleanFacet, SingleLinksFacet } from "@elastic/react-search-ui-views";

<Facet
  field="tv_smart_tv"
  label="Smart TV"
  view={BooleanFacet}
/>
<Facet
  field="tv_resolution"
  label="Resolution"
  view={SingleLinksFacet}
/>
<Facet
  field="tv_size"
  label="Diagonal size"
  filterType="any" // accepts "all", "any" and "none"
  // Using the default view={MultiCheckboxFacet}
/>
```

And the resulting UI:

  size="l"
  alt="Facet views"
/>

You might need a facet that Search UI doesn't offer, for example a dedicated color-picker. With Search UI you can build your own custom facet that will work just like a native one.
